@Model.Site.Config["urlnohttp"] was, at one point, the official website of Troop 53 of Castleton.  However, through the years, the website eventually went down, and the domain expired.  The website's domain was purchased by Seth Hendrick, who became Eagle Scout during his time in Troop 53 in 2009.

Upon purchasing the expired domain, the website became a single webpage, that contained links to an archived version of the website.

That changed in 2024, when the Troop turned 100 years old.  To celebrate the event, Seth resurrected the website to include much of the information from the old website, along with new information as well.  There's a lot of good memories from the troop that deserve to be front-and-center, and not just off on some archive service.

As it stands right now, however, this website is not officially affiliated with the Troop.  Seth has since moved away from Castleton, and regretfully lost contact with the troop.  If you are part of BSA Troop 53, please contact Seth at seth@@shendrick.net, and perhaps it can be made official again!
