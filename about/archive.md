### File list

Each file has three links associated with it:

* Direct - Link to the original file.  Use this one to start with.
* Web Archive - An alternative link in case the original file went down.  This is powered by archive.org's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).  Use this one if the direct link fails.
* IPFS Link - Another alternative link in case the previous mentioned links no longer work.  See [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) on Wikipedia on what IPFS is.  Use this link as a last resort; it takes the longest to download, and may not even work.
