## Media Archives

Various Castleton, NY Scouting America Troops have been in the news over the years.  Below is a list of archived newspapers, town documents, and other forms of media that contains information about Troop 53, Troop 253, Pack 253, or Sea Scout Crew 153.

Each file has three links associated with it:

* Direct - Link to the original file.  Use this one to start with.
* Web Archive - An alternative link in case the original file went down.  This is powered by archive.org's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).  Use this one if the direct link fails.
* IPFS Link - Another alternative link in case the previous mentioned links no longer work.  See [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) on Wikipedia on what IPFS is.  Use this link as a last resort; it takes the longest to download, and may not even work.

If you are more technically minded and want to metadata used to generate this page to download the files en masse yourself, please visit the [file metadata](/fileinfo/index.html) page.
