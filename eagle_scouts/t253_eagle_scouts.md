In the 1960's when Scouting became hugely popular, a second Boy Scout Troop was formed in the Castleton area.  This unit was designated Troop 253, and it met in South Schodack.  Troop 253 has since been disbanded, however the number 253 is still used as Castleton's Cub Scout Pack unit number.

Below are the scouts of Troop 253 that have achieved scouting's highest rank.

Eagles that do not currently have a photo available are represented by the Eagle Scout Badge.
