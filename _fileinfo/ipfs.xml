    IPFS hashes of all the files in fileinfo.xml.
    This is its own separate file since it must be generated
    by a machine that has all of the pdfs mirrored AND
    has access to an IPFS node.

    If Seth is no longer maintaining the website, its probably
    best to just delete this file, unless you know what IPFS is.
