    <Notes>It is not known for sure if this picture was taken during the camporee described in the article.  However, the date of the photo is 1944.  There are also eight Sea Scouts - the same amount as in the article.  While it isn't 100% certain, there is a high probability that this photo is from this camporee.</Notes>
