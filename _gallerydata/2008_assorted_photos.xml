    These 2 photos are from a troop meeting most likely in fall or winter 2008.
    Seth's uniform has an OA patch, which he got summer 2008.  Photo was taken
    by Jim Gutta, who aged out in 2009.

      This is from a troop meeting most likely in fall or winter 2008.
      Its dark out, so it must be after moving the clocks back an hour.
      Class A's are being worn, so most likely the first Wednesday meeting of the month.
      Seth's uniform has an OA patch, which he got summer 2008.  Photo was taken by Jim Gutta, who aged out in 2009.
      Estimated date is early December, 2008.
