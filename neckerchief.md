This year, Troop 53 turned 100 years old!  To celebrate, some Troop 53 alumni are chipping in to update the scout's neckerchiefs.

They've gotten some quotes from "recommended" BSA sources such as [classb.com](https://www.classb.com/bsa/neckerchiefs), but they're a bit out of their budget range of $400-$450 for 35 neckerchiefs.  We're open to other shops to make the neckerchiefs.

## Design

Below is the design we want to go with.

## Specifications

* **Size:** 35"x35"x49"
* **Background Color:** Purple
* **Edging Color:** White
* **Logo & Text:** Embroidered

## Wishlist

* 35 neckerchiefs are needed to start with to make sure the scouts have enough.  There will probably be a smaller second batch later this year for adult leaders and others who want one.
* Ideally, the 35 neckerchiefs should be ready to be picked up by noon on May 24, 2024.
* Budget: $400-$450 for 35 neckerchiefs.

## Other notes

* We unfortunately do not have the raw material to make the neckerchiefs.
