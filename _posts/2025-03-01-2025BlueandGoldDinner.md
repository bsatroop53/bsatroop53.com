The Blue and Gold Dinner is an annual dinner where Cub Scouts from Pack 253 cross over to become members of Troop 53.

This year, Troop 53 scouts served dinner at the Blue and Gold Dinner and congratulated Cub Scouts on crossing the bridge.

Traditionally, scouts from Troop 53 help remove the Webelos neckerchief from the cubs and replace it with a Scouts BSA neckerchief as they cross over.
