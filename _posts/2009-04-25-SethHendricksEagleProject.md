[Sacred Heart Church](https://www.sacredheartcastleton.org/) a local Catholic church located in the Village of Castleton at 3 Catholic Way.  It is here that Seth Hendrick's Eagle Scout project is located.

The project consisted of adding a chain railing along a footpath between the church's parking lot and the church itself.  In addition, a garden was next to the path with a tree planted.

This consisted of several work days across multiple weeks.  The main work day was in April 2009, where the Troop helped Seth after cleaning up 9J.  It was a busy day for all involved.

Seth Hendrick became an Eagle Scout in June 2009.  As of March 2024, the railing is still standing at the church.
