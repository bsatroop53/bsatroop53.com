During the summer of 2004, the troop went to [Rotary Scout Reservation](https://rsrbsa.org/) for a week.

The scouts camped, shot archery, swam, canoed, and made baskets at handicraft.  This year, the troop stayed at the Algonquin campsite within camp Rotary, which is just outside of center camp.  The camp also had a pirate theme as well for the week.

On Wednesday, as is tradition, parents of the scouts were invited to the camp for a cook-out.  Many of the photos below were from that day.
