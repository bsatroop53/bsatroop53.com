Troop 53 is part of the Adopt-A-Highway program, where once or twice a year the troop picks up garbage along route 9J that runs on the western border of Castleton and Schodack.  The stretch of road is roughly two miles, and it starts from the Schodack/East Greenbush border, and goes south until the Village of Castleton.

In 2002, the troop continued with this tradition.  Fourteen scouts and adults helped pick up trash along route 9J.
