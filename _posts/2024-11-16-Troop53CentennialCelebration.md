March 7, 2024 was an important milestone in Troop 53's history.  It was its 100th birthday!  To celebrate, the troop celebrated with a dinner and court of honor at the Schodack Central School District's District Office (formerly Maple Hill Middle School).  Current troop members, troop alumni, and friends of the troop were invited.

The night was full of speeches, food, desert, photos, and memories.

Here's to 100 more years of bringing scouting to Castleton, NY!
