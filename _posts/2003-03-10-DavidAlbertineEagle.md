After twelve years on the trail to Eagle, eighteen year old P. David Albertine, II received BSA Eagle Scout at a Court of Honor held on March 8th, 2003 at the South Schodack Firehouse. David, a member of Troop 53 of Castleton, NY has been a member of the Boy Scouts since 1991 when he became a Tiger Cub in Pack 253, also of Castleton. Troop 53 is sponsored by the Village of Castleton. Pack 253 is sponsored by the Castleton Kiwanis Club.

On hand for the ceremony were Rensselaer County Legislators Margaret Van Duesen and Edward Schwartz, Jr., Schodack Town Supervisor Eileen Natoli, Retired Justice from the Town of Schodack and Village of Nassau Alexander A. Shannon and Castleton Mayor Robert Sancomb.

David's Eagle Scout project was to create a Nature Trail and trail improvements at the Schodack Town Park. David has 23 merit badges, is a Brotherhood member of the Order of the Arrow, Haudenosaunee Lodge 19, has served on Rotary Scout Reservation Staff for 2 summers. David's leadership positions include Patrol Leader, Quartermaster, Assistant Senior Patrol Leader and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. David, who is an active member of Clearview Christian and Missionary Alliance's youth group, spent the summer of 2002 on an 8 week long teen missionary trip to Honduras. David has participated in the NRA Youth Shooting Program sponsored by the Nassau Sportsman Club and has achieved Sharpshooter Bar 9. David is a senior at Latham Christian Academy, where he received the Pastor's Award in 2002. David is also a member of Vedder Composite Squadron, Civil Air Patrol. David is a second generation Eagle Scout. His father, Paul D. Albertine, serves as Scoutmaster of Troop 53 and earned his Eagle Scout in 1976, also as a member of Troop 53. David is the 27th Eagle Scout from Troop 53, during it's 79 year history.

David, who completed the requirements for Eagle just days before the deadline of his eighteenth birthday, shares these words with fellow scouts seeking BSA's highest rank "If there is one valuable lesson that I can pass on it's "Don't wait to the last minute"". David's requirements were completed just 4 days before his 18th birthday. David also presented a gift to honored guest, Eagle Scout Russell Van de Wal, who earned his Eagle in 1941 as a member of Troop 53.

David's plans for the future include college and a career in aviation, possibly as a Missionary Pilot. David has not ruled out a career in the military.
