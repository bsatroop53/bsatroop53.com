For Seth's Eagle Scout service project, he organized a series of concerts at the Riverside Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing.  He and his fellow students played a concert once a month for six months.

Darlene Miller, the former librarian at the Castleton Public Library, was the activities director at Riverside and helped Seth achieve his goal.  His first concert was on December 27th 2017, and was Christmas themed.
