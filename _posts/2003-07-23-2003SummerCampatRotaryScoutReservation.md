During the summer of 2003, the troop went to [Rotary Scout Reservation](https://rsrbsa.org/) for a week.

During this trip, the troop was in the Thunderbird camping site, one of, if not the, furthest camp site away from center camp.

This particular camping trip had a bad thunder storm, which may have had a tornado warning.  The entire camp had to seek shelter.  The troop had to brave the long hike from the Thunderbird camping site to the Seneca lodge's basement.  Thankfully, no one got hurt, but some shoes got very muddy from the rain.
