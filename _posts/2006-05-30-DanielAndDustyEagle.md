The South Schodack Fire House was the setting for a May 28 dual Eagle Scout Award Ceremony.  The Sunday evening ceremony honored brothers, Daniel and Dustin Albertine, of Castleton Boy Scout Troop 53.  Troop 53 is chartered with the Boy Scouts of America through the Kiwanis Club of Castleton.

The Eagle Scout Award, Scouting’s highest youth honor, was presented to the young men before a gathering of family, friends and dignitaries, at a traditional Court of Honor staged by the boys and leaders of Troop 53.

Daniel and Dusty represent the 40th and 41st Eagle Scouts in the 82 year history of Troop 53. It also represents the culmination within the Albertine family of a strong scouting tradition. Daniel and Dusty’s older brother, David, in addition to their father, Paul D. Albertine have also earned the Eagle Award as members of the troop.

Daniel’s Eagle Scout project was to map and mark all of the fire hydrants in the Castleton water system.  Daniel came up with this idea after the scouts were not able to find most of the hydrants covered by the snows of the 2003-2004 winter season.  Daniel has earned 28 merit badges, and is a Vigil member of the Order of the Arrow, Haudenosaunee Lodge 19.  Daniel is the first scout from Troop 53 to have received this honor.  Daniel’s leadership positions include Patrol Leader, Quartermaster, Assistant Senior Patrol Leader and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster.  Daniel has also has earned the Bronze Palm for completing 3 months since his board of review, 3 hours of community service and 5 additional merit badges over the 21 required for Eagle.  Daniel earned his God & Me, and God & Family religious awards as a scout.

Dusty’s Eagle Scout project was to raise funds to assist the Nassau Police Department’s K-9 unit, Officer Tai Slagen and K9 Officer Emma, a German Rottweiller.  Dusty came up with this idea after Officer Slagen inquired about receiving scout assistance in fundraising.  Dusty raised over $1300 through T-Shirt sales, a car wash, speaking at civic organizations and writing local businesses requesting support.  Chief Peter presented Dusty with a plaque, on behalf of the Nassau Police, thanking him for his fundraising efforts.  Dusty has earned 29 merit badges, and is a Brotherhood member of the Order of the Arrow, Haudenosaunee Lodge 19.  Dusty’s leadership positions include Patrol Leader, Quartermaster, Senior Patrol Leader and he was recently appointed as Junior Assistant Scoutmaster.

Daniel and Dusty have been members of the Boy Scouts since they were in the first grade, starting as Tiger Cubs in Castleton Pack 253. Both boys earned the Arrow of Light award as Webelos scouts, during which time Daniel set his goal on earning every Webelos activity pin.

Both Daniel and Dusty were part of the Twin Rivers Council contingent to attend the 2005 National Jamboree in Fort A.P. Hill, VA.  Both boys have recently returned home from a two-week Order of the Arrow Trek into the Minnesota Boundary Waters Canoeing area, where they spent one week repairing portage trails and one week exploring the wilderness, seeing a cow moose with her calves and several Bald Eagles on their trek.
