Every year, the Troop marches in the Castleton / Schodack Memorial day parade. 2024 was no exception.  This year was the troop's centennial year, and the troop was given purple centennial neckerchiefs to celebrate!

Below are a couple of photos of the Troop marching along the parade route in the Village of Castleton.
