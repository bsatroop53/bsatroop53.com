Brett’s Eagle Court of Honor is scheduled for:

Brett is the son of Bruce and Janet Wagner of Schodack.  Brett started in scouting as a Tiger Cub with Cub Scout Pack 253 in 1997, and has been active for 11 years.  He has earned 29 merit badges, 21 of which are required for the rank of Eagle.  He has served the troop as Patrol Leader, Assistant Patrol Leader, Instructor and Librarian.  For his Eagle Service Project, he designed and led a team in the construction of a 60’ x 30’ sand volleyball court on the grounds of the First United Methodist Church in East Greenbush. The project required the clearing of a field, bulldozing (donated by Vincent Brewer), 6 3/8 tons of sand (a substantial portion of which was donated by Jude Clemente of Troy Sand & Gravel), 200 linear feet of railroad-tie type wood (some donated by Curtis Lumber in Schodack) and much hard labor. On January 1, 2003, Brett was one of the 62 Scouts (equal numbers of Boys & Girls) carrying a county flag (Washington) in the color guard for Gov. Pataki’s last inauguration.

Brett is a junior at Maple Hill High School, where he has been named to the Principal’s List (95% or greater average) in each quarter of high school and is a member of the National Honor Society.  He participates in Key Club, Chorus, Swing Choir and in Band (1st Clarinet, an instrument he has played for 7 years), and has studied piano for 10 years. Brett has devoted much time over the last 10 years to dance, and has for the past 6 years been a member of the Isabelle School of Dance Competition Team, through which he competes in tap, jazz, ballet, lyrical, modern, musical theatre and ballroom styles.  Having just completed his 3rd year as an assistant teacher at the Isabelle School, he has helped to instruct tap and jazz classes.  Brett performed his own choreography for incidental tap dances in the high school Drama Club’s performances of The Sting and Get Smart.
