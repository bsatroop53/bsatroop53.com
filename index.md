Welcome to the website of Troop 53 of Castleton, NY!

## Troop 53 Turns 100

2024 is the 100-year anniversary of Troop 53!  To celebrate, the old troop website was found from the [archives](/about/archive.html) and remade to what you see today!

If you are a current or former member of the Troop, and wish to add a post to this site, please checkout the editor at [https://edit.bsatroop53.com/](https://edit.bsatroop53.com/).  Posts can be photos of camping trips or outings, Eagle projects, Dutch oven recipes, or pretty much anything related to the troop.

### Centennial Celebration

There are plans to have a centennial celebration Memorial Day Weekend, 2024.  Stay tuned to this website for details.  There is also a Centennial Celebration [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550093638626) as well.
