This website has a list of files that are useful for scouts or adult volunteers to reference located [here](/files/index.html).

For those who are more technically minded and wish to mass-download these files, there are two XML files one can download to help.

[This XML file](/fileinfo/fileinfo.xml) contains information such as what the file is, the various editions, and the URLs in which to download them from.

* OrignalUrl - The Direct Link
* ArchiveOrgUrl - The link to an archived version via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

[This XML file](/fileinfo/ipfs.xml) contains [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) CIDs of each of the files.  One of the former troop members maintains their own IPFS node, and mirrors all of the files on it in case the original URL and the archive.org URL go down.  It also means anyone else running an IPFS node can also mirror the files as well.  If this page 404's it means the IPFS node is most likely offline.  The "name" attribute in the nodes in this file match the "filename" attribute in the [other fileinfo file](/fileinfo/fileinfo.xml).

These files are _not_ hosted directly by this website, but other websites.  If you do opt to use these XML files to mass-download the files, please be a good web citizen and add some kind of rate-limiting so you don't swamp servers.
