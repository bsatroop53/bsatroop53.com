2024 is a special year, Troop 53 turned 100 years old!  The troop is planning several ways to celebrate.

## Photo Collection

The troop is collecting photos all across the troop history, and adding them to this very [website](/photos/AllPhotos.html).  If you have photos of past troop events, and are comfortable having photos added to this website, please fill out form located here: [https://edit.bsatroop53.com/](https://edit.bsatroop53.com/).

If you are an Eagle scout who got their award after 2009, please send a photo of yourself from around the time when you earned your Eagle Award if you are comfortable doing so.  That way, it can be added to the [Eagle Scout page](/eagle_scouts.html) on this website.
